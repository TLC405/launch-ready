TLC STUDIOS REWIND™ - SINGULARITY PROTOCOL MAXIMUM
A TRIBUTE TO THE LEGENDS WHO LIVE FOREVER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

▓▓▓ CRITICAL: ABSOLUTE PHOTOREALISM ▓▓▓
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:
• Generate a REAL PHOTOGRAPH - NOT AI art, NOT illustration, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized
• Must be INDISTINGUISHABLE from an authentic period photograph
• Every human face must look like a REAL HUMAN BEING with:
  - Real skin texture with pores, subtle imperfections, natural shine
  - Real eye moisture and light reflections
  - Natural facial asymmetry present in all real humans
  - Real fabric textures, real lighting physics, real depth of field
• Use authentic period camera characteristics:
  - Real film grain patterns specific to that era's film stocks
  - Real lens aberrations, bokeh, vignetting from period lenses
  - Real color science (Kodachrome, Ektachrome, Fuji, etc.)
• If the result looks "AI-generated" or "artistic" - IT HAS FAILED

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
▓▓▓ ULTRA FACE LOCK PROTOCOL - FACE ONLY, NO HAIR/BEARD ▓▓▓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE USER'S FACE MUST BE TRANSPLANTED PERFECTLY:
• Extract ONLY THE FACE from reference - NOTHING ELSE
• NEVER copy hair from source photo - style hair for ERA instead
• NEVER copy beard/facial hair from source - style for ERA instead
• NEVER copy hats, glasses, or accessories - remove them all
• The source photo is ONLY for FACIAL STRUCTURE reference
• Face must SEAMLESSLY blend into the scene as if photographed there
• Facial structure, bone placement, proportions: 100% PRESERVED
• Eyes: exact shape, exact spacing, exact color, exact lash length
• Nose: exact shape, exact nostrils, exact bridge, exact tip - DO NOT ENLARGE
• Mouth: exact lip shape, exact teeth if visible
• Jawline, chin, cheekbones: PIXEL-PERFECT MATCH
• Skin tone and texture: IDENTICAL (adjust only for era lighting)
• Any unique features (moles, scars, dimples): MUST BE VISIBLE
• The face must look like the SAME PERSON photographed in that era

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
▓▓▓ NATURAL COMPOSITION - NO STACKING ▓▓▓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
• Celebrities positioned at REALISTIC distances (5-15 feet apart)
• NO ONE overlapping or "stacked" on top of each other
• Natural depth - some people closer to camera, some further away
• User is CENTER but composition BREATHES with space around them
• Shot from realistic camera angle (photographer POV)
• Background people at PROPER distance, slightly blurred
• Each person has their OWN SPACE - no crowding

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CELEBRITY LIKENESS - REAL PEOPLE, NOT CARICATURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Every celebrity MUST be their REAL SELVES:
• Reference actual photographs of them at that exact age/era
• Real skin, real proportions, real subtle asymmetries
• NOT stylized, NOT beautified, NOT cartoonified
• They look like they would in a candid photograph

OKLAHOMA CITY CORNER – WILL WORK FOR LOVE
A TLC TRIBUTE TO HUMAN DIGNITY & RESILIENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHOTOGRAPH SPECIFICATIONS:
• Powerful modern street photography
• Natural overcast light, wet pavement reflections
• Shallow depth of field
• Documentary DIGNITY, never exploitation
• Pulitzer Prize quality

THE SCENE:
A moving portrait of the USER and THREE LEGENDARY COMPANIONS on a real Oklahoma City street corner. They are ALL homeless TOGETHER. SOLIDARITY and BROTHERHOOD.

COMPOSITION - STREET CORNER:
• User SEATED on milk crate, CENTER
• Robin Williams sitting 3ft to LEFT on ground
• Warren Buffett sitting 3ft to RIGHT on cardboard
• Bill Gates sitting 4ft away on overturned bucket
• Stray dog pressed against user
• OKC skyline in BACKGROUND
• Passing cars and pedestrians in FAR distance

USER POSITIONING & STYLING:
• Sitting on milk crate at intersection
• Cardboard sign: "WILL WORK FOR LOVE"
• Making DIRECT eye contact with camera
• WEARING: Worn, dirty, layered clothes - multiple hoodies, ripped jacket
• HAIR: MAXIMUM HOMELESS CHAOS - the craziest Einstein-on-meth mess imaginable, long matted tangles going in EVERY direction at once, greasy and unwashed for months, sticking straight up AND falling over face, leaves and debris tangled in, the hair of someone who lost their brush in 2019
• FACIAL HAIR: EPIC HOMELESS PATRIARCH BEARD - ZZ Top length disaster reaching belly, scraggly tangled mess, possibly graying from stress, food crumbs visible, the magnificent beard of a man who has STORIES
• Dirt on face, weathered skin, but FIERCE DIGNITY in eyes
• WEDDING RING still on finger—love persists

THE LEGENDARY HOMELESS COMPANIONS:
• ROBIN WILLIAMS (AS HOMELESS) - wild crazy unkempt gray hair, long scraggly beard, dirty worn clothes - sitting 3ft to LEFT on ground, still has gentle smile in eyes, sign: "WILL DO COMEDY FOR FOOD"
• WARREN BUFFETT (AS HOMELESS) - disheveled white hair, scraggly beard, dirty old suit jacket over layers - sitting 3ft to RIGHT on cardboard, holding coffee cup for change
• BILL GATES (AS HOMELESS) - messy graying hair, unkempt beard growing in, glasses held with tape, oversized dirty sweater - sitting 4ft away on bucket, broken laptop in hands

ALL THREE CELEBRITIES ARE HOMELESS:
• ACTUALLY homeless - not ghosts, not spirits
• Sitting WITH user as brothers in struggle
• Dirty clothes, weathered skin, wild unkempt hair and beards
• But RECOGNIZABLE faces beneath homeless aesthetic

OKC LANDMARKS VISIBLE:
• Devon Tower in background
• Paycom Center visible
• Scissortail Park/Skydance Bridge
• Oklahoma City Thunder banner on lamppost

TLC EASTER EGGS:
• "TLC" hand-stitched on user's hoodie
• TLC scratched into milk crate
• Bus stop ad: "TLC Studios - Everyone Has A Story"
• Graffiti: "TLC LOVES YOU"`,
