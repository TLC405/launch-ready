TLC STUDIOS REWIND™ - SINGULARITY PROTOCOL MAXIMUM
A TRIBUTE TO THE LEGENDS WHO LIVE FOREVER
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

▓▓▓ CRITICAL: ABSOLUTE PHOTOREALISM ▓▓▓
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION:
• Generate a REAL PHOTOGRAPH - NOT AI art, NOT illustration, NOT cartoon, NOT stylized
• Must be INDISTINGUISHABLE from an authentic period photograph
• Every human face must look like a REAL HUMAN BEING with:
  - Real skin texture with pores, subtle imperfections, natural shine
  - Real eye moisture and light reflections
  - Natural facial asymmetry present in all real humans
  - Real fabric textures, real lighting physics, real depth of field
• Use authentic period camera characteristics:
  - Real film grain patterns specific to that era's film stocks
  - Real lens aberrations, bokeh, vignetting from period lenses
  - Real color science (Kodachrome, Ektachrome, Fuji, etc.)
• If the result looks "AI-generated" or "artistic" - IT HAS FAILED

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
▓▓▓ FACE LOCK PROTOCOL - ZERO TOLERANCE ▓▓▓
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
THE USER'S FACE MUST BE TRANSPLANTED PERFECTLY:
• Do NOT generate a new face - USE the exact face from reference photo
• The face must SEAMLESSLY blend into the scene as if photographed there
• Facial structure, bone placement, proportions: 100% PRESERVED
• Eyes: exact shape, exact spacing, exact color, exact lash length
• Nose: exact shape, exact nostrils, exact bridge, exact tip
• Mouth: exact lip shape, exact teeth if visible
• Jawline, chin, cheekbones: PIXEL-PERFECT MATCH
• Skin tone and texture: IDENTICAL (adjust only for era lighting)
• Any unique features (moles, scars, dimples): MUST BE VISIBLE
• Expression: Confident but NATURAL to the user's face structure
• The face must look like the SAME PERSON photographed in that era
• NOT a "version" of them, NOT "inspired by" - THE ACTUAL FACE

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SOURCE IMAGE ARTIFACT REMOVAL - CRITICAL
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
• REMOVE any hats, caps, beanies from the source photo - DO NOT TRANSFER to output
• REMOVE any glasses or sunglasses from source - DO NOT TRANSFER
• REMOVE any accessories that hide or obscure facial features
• Only use the NAKED FACE from the reference - style hair for the ERA, not from source
• The user's hair should be styled ERA-APPROPRIATELY, not copied from their selfie

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
FACIAL PROPORTION PRESERVATION - ZERO TOLERANCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
• NOSE: Preserve EXACT nose - same width, bridge height, nostril shape, tip angle
• DO NOT enlarge the nose - this is a common AI error that MUST be avoided
• DO NOT modify nose proportions in ANY way - copy exactly from reference
• EYES: Same shape, spacing, size - no enlargement or reduction
• MOUTH: Same lip shape, width, proportions
• JAWLINE: Same jaw shape, chin prominence, face width
• All facial ratios must be IDENTICAL to the source photo

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
CELEBRITY LIKENESS - REAL PEOPLE, NOT CARICATURES
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Every celebrity MUST be their REAL SELVES:
• Reference actual photographs of them at that exact age/era
• Real skin, real proportions, real subtle asymmetries
• NOT stylized, NOT beautified, NOT cartoonified
• They look like they would in a candid photograph
• DIVERSE: All races, backgrounds, walks of life represented
• Presidents, musicians, athletes, comedians, activists

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
COMPOSITION & LIGHTING - PHOTOGRAPH, NOT PAINTING
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
• Lighting must follow real physics - motivated light sources
• Shadows, highlights, falloff behave as in real photography
• Depth of field from real camera lenses
• User is CENTER but composition is natural, not forced
• Environmental details are specific and authentic to era

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

• Sunset painting the sky in oranges, pinks, and purples
• Distant mountains with snow caps catching last light
• Ancient forest in the valley below - primitive trees, ferns
• Small campfire glowing nearby (controlled fire = civilization)

• Warmth, safety, wisdom - the foundation of humanity
• This is an ANCESTOR to be proud of

SPIRITUAL ELEMENT (subtle):
• In the sunset clouds, very faint suggestion of future cities

OKLAHOMA CITY CORNER – WILL WORK FOR LOVE
A TLC TRIBUTE TO HUMAN DIGNITY & RESILIENCE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PHOTOGRAPH SPECIFICATIONS:
• Powerful modern street photography
• Natural overcast light, wet pavement reflections
• Shallow depth of field: user SHARP, city soft
• Documentary DIGNITY, never exploitation
• Pulitzer Prize quality

THE SCENE:
A moving portrait of the USER and THREE LEGENDARY COMPANIONS on a real Oklahoma City street corner. They are ALL homeless TOGETHER - sitting side by side on the corner. This is about solidarity, brotherhood, and the human spirit. Not pity—POWER. Not despair—DIGNITY.

USER POSITIONING & STYLING:
• Sitting on milk crate at intersection of Reno & Walker, OKC
• Cardboard sign held with PRIDE: "WILL WORK FOR LOVE"
• Making DIRECT eye contact with camera—challenging, not defeated
• Loyal stray dog pressed against side, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
• WEARING: Worn, dirty, layered clothes - multiple hoodies, ripped jacket
• HAIR: Wild, crazy, unkempt, unwashed - LONG and tangled, sticking up
• BEARD: Long, scraggly, unkempt beard (if male) - homeless aesthetic
• Dirt on face, weathered skin, but DIGNITY in eyes
• NO HAT from source photo - hair is wild and free
• WEDDING RING still on finger—a story of love that persists

THE LEGENDARY HOMELESS COMPANIONS (sitting WITH user on the corner):
• ROBIN WILLIAMS - AS A HOMELESS MAN: wild crazy unkempt hair, long scraggly gray beard, dirty worn clothes, sitting RIGHT NEXT to user, still has that gentle smile in his eyes despite circumstances, cardboard sign that says "WILL DO COMEDY FOR FOOD"
• WARREN BUFFETT - AS A HOMELESS MAN: disheveled white hair, scraggly beard, dirty old suit jacket over multiple layers, sitting on user's other side, holding coffee cup for change, looks like a wise old man of the streets
• BILL GATES - AS A HOMELESS MAN: messy graying hair, unkempt stubble growing into beard, glasses held together with tape, oversized dirty sweater, sitting nearby with a broken laptop, still trying to compute something

ALL THREE CELEBRITIES:
• They are ACTUALLY homeless - not ghosts, not spirits, not watching from afar
• They are sitting WITH the user on the same corner as brothers in struggle
• Dirty clothes, weathered skin, wild unkempt hair and beards
• But maintaining their RECOGNIZABLE faces beneath the homeless aesthetic
• Solidarity - they're all in this together

OKC LANDMARKS CLEARLY VISIBLE:
• Paycom Center in background
• Devon Tower in distance, reaching toward sky
• Scissortail Park/Skydance Bridge visible
• Oklahoma City Thunder banner on lamppost
• Bricktown in distance
• REAL Oklahoma City, not generic

THE ENVIRONMENT:
• Busy OKC intersection, cars passing, life continuing
• Rain-slicked pavement, puddles reflecting streetlights
• Overcast Oklahoma sky breaking with single ray of sunlight on the group
• Shopping cart with belongings, cardboard boxes, sleeping bags
• Coffee cups, cigarette butts, the reality of street life
• GRITTY but with BROTHERHOOD and DIGNITY

EMOTIONAL TRUTH:
• This is about SOLIDARITY and BROTHERHOOD
• Four men who could have been anything - together on the corner
• Not mockery, not pity - POWER in unity
• The dog sees what others miss
• We are all one moment away from needing love
• Even legends can fall - and there's dignity in survival

TLC EASTER EGGS:
• Small "TLC" hand-stitched on user's hoodie
• TLC scratched into milk crate
• Bus stop ad: "TLC Studios Rewind - Everyone Has A Story"
• Graffiti on wall spells "TLC LOVES YOU"`,
