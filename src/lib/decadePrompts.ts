// SINGULARITY PROTOCOL: SAFE EDITION
// Non-photorealistic, illustrated style with extreme face lock on user only

export const masterStyleBlock = `SINGULARITY PROTOCOL: ENGAGED.

GLOBAL STYLE:
* This is NOT a photo. Render in a premium, non-photorealistic style: high-end illustration / painted concept art / graphic novel cover.
* Think: ultra-detailed, cinematic digital painting or hand-painted poster, not a camera snapshot.
* Strong depth, parallax, and composition so the scene feels 3D and immersive, but clearly stylized (brush strokes, line work, painterly lighting).
* Color grading should match the era but always look like artwork, not a photograph.
* Main character (the user) has EXTREME FACE LOCK: match face structure, nose, eyes, jaw, hair, and vibe from the reference photo.
* Real celebrities and historical figures should be clearly recognizable as stylized portraits, NOT photoreal deepfakes.
* TLC Easter eggs must exist in-world (signs, lights, props, clothing labels) but never as modern logos slapped on top.
* No gore, no sexual content, no humiliation. Scenes should feel epic, respectful, larger-than-life.

SUBJECT MATRIX:
* ONE (1) USER as the central protagonist in each scene.
* Multiple legendary figures around them, depending on era.
* Do NOT duplicate any person within a single scene.

FACE LOCK RULES:
* User: strongest possible likeness within stylized art.
* Celebrities: stylized, iconic likeness but clearly drawn/painted, not photorealistic, and never with the user's face copied onto them.

MOOD:
* Every frame feels like a legendary album cover or movie poster where the user is the central mythic figure in history.

CRITICAL:
* Always keep the user as the star.
* Always keep celebrities non-photoreal and stylized.
* No instruction to replace, merge, or clone real people's faces.`;
